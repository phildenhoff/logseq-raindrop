- [ ] Add new elements to the top of the list based on sort order, e.g. newest first
  - so if I have a list like this:
    - Articles:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
  - and then resync, my NEW list is
    - Articles:
      - x
      - y
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
- [ ] Upserting
  - If a block exists in the page that has content matching the highlight, re-render that block using the highlight and note.
    - that seems like it would re-render everything...? v expensive??
- [ ] Split up `importHighlightsSinceLastSync` into smaller functions
- [ ] Update the page generator to start the next request just before yielding
  - See https://github.com/phildenhoff/logseq-raindrop/pull/50#discussion_r1224999537
- [ ] Organize settings interfaces, there shall be only one. Maybe two.
- [ ] Redirect to the page Raindrop page by default when syncing begins.
- [ ] Add a "Syncing..." notification
- [ ] Sync on a schedule
- [ ] Clean up UI for syncing, remove the drop down menu and just have a small element (a-la Omnivore) that indicates syncing has begun & that we're redirecting.
- [ ] Add "last synced" to the page
- [ ] Add "last updated" to each bookmark
- [ ] Rename "Articles" to Bookmarks — match Raindrop.io terminology
  - This is an overhaul — replace "raindrop" with Bookmark everywhere.
